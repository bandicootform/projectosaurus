# Bandicoot Form

Bandicoot Form is my personal project built with **Next.js** and deployed on **Vercel**. Itâ€™s a space where I get to share my design work, experiment with new ideas, and have fun with web development. 

Powered by **Rex the Breathtaker**, this project is all about mixing creativity and code to showcase Rex's journey in design. Simple, fast, and always evolving!
